      <title>Compact Operators and Spectral Intuition</title>

      <description>Functional analysis has a reputation for being abstract and “soft”.&#xA;But once you internalise compact operators on Hilbert spaces, a lot of the theory suddenly feels almost finite-dimensional again.&#xA;This post is a somewhat opinionated walkthrough of:&#xA;compact operators on Hilbert spaces, the structure of their spectrum, and how to think about them using finite-dimensional approximations and a bit of code. Along the way we’ll sprinkle some numerical experiments and quotes, to make it feel less like lecture notes and more like a working notebook.</description>

      <title>Quotients, Intuitively</title>

      <description>Quotients are one of those ideas that appear everywhere. At a very crude level, a quotient is what you get when you declare some points to be the same.&#xA;Formally, start with a set $X$ and an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $X$. The quotient $X / \sim$ is the set of equivalence classes $[x]$, where&#xA;$$ [x] = { y \in X : y \sim x }. $$&#xA;The canonical surjection</description>

      <title>Listening Log: Week 1</title>

      <description>Some things I listened to this week:&#xA;An annoyingly catchy pop album A dense modern jazz record that I only half-understand A string quartet where the harmonic language felt weirdly “probabilistic” One recurring thought: a lot of music feels like it is exploring a space of transformations rather than a fixed melody. That is not far from how I think about symmetry groups in mathematics.</description>

      <description>This is a placeholder post. Another footnote example appears here.1&#xA;Inline math such as $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ should render via KaTeX, and display math should also work:&#xA;$$ \int_0^1 x^2 , dx = \frac{1}{3}. $$&#xA;A short code snippet:&#xA;1 2 def square(x): return x * x This explains something related to the theorem above.&amp;#160;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;</description>

      <title>A Note on Reading Mathematics</title>

      <description>People often talk about reading mathematics as if it were like reading a novel. It really is not.&#xA;A more realistic model: you are trying to compress a long argument into a small, robust mental structure. That requires:&#xA;Skimming for global structure Filling in local details where your intuition fails Trying to reproduce the argument from memory The posts on this site are written with that workflow in mind: they should be easy to skim, but also withstand careful reading.</description>
