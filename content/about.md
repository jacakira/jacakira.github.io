## Hobbies

Outside of math and ML, I have a great interest in classical music. In particular, I have a fondness for the works of Bach, Mozart, Brahms, Schumann and Chopin. I regularly attend concerts, both in the UK and abroad, and can often be found enjoying a chamber music programme at [Wigmore Hall](https://www.wigmore-hall.org.uk/).
